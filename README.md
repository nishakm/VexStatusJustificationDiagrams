This repo is to update the diagrams being used in the VEX document.

The diagrams are made with draw.io.
They are png's with the draw.io source included,
so they can be edited directly with draw.io.

Release v0.1.0 are the files as reviewed at the 2022-06-13 VEX Meeting.

The files were renamed to the sections of the document in which they appear.
